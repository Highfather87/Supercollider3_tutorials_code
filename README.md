SuperCollider 3 tutorials code
==============================

These are snippets coded while watching the YouTube series [SuperCollider Tutorials by Eli Fieldsteel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRzsOOiJ_p4&list=PLPYzvS8A_rTaNDweXe6PX4CXSGq4iEWYC)

These code snippets are reproduced with Eli's consent and I have done so primarily for my own convenience. Learn SC by coding along with ELi in the videos, and pause the videos mercilessly to allow your fingers to catch up with the code on-screen. The videos are edited nicely to keep them short, quite a lot of coding happens in fastforward. Most code snippets evolve from simple to complex over the course of several minutes. I wanted to keep track of the various stages in-between, and record the occassional comment to reinforce what's going on.
